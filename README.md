Hello, I am Rakhi , Currently a junior year(3rd year) undergraduate student. 
I am at a funny stage of life where curiosity drives me to explore and learn. Design interests me and so does technology. I enjoy nature and consider it the ideal source for design learning. I love to Play Badminton, listen to music. I consider myself as a quick learner, and believe in spreading happiness to create a better world!. My Crazyness for Design , Web , Application and Other technologies is growing up with the growing years.  I maintain this page as documentation of that work.

Technology Used: HTML5 CSS3 LINUX/GNU GIMP SUBLIME TEXT.
